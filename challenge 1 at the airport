challenge 1 at the airport
	amenities 
		time for a sandwich?
		order one and have it delivered?
	time
		waiting is bad (duh)
		assess stress levels experienced by passengers
		get guests to buy more stuff at the airport, entertainment,comfort traveling

	gamification
	location services
	lots of partners to and from the airport


corporate customers
	make flying and booking much easier
	easier to change flights due to long meetings or unexpected events
	flights are delayed : requires shuffling meeting plans











Ideas:
Some automated way to find out if people who are willing to give up their airline ticket to those who really need it in return for some ameneties, later free flight, hotels, maybe a seat upgrade. System doesn't exist we'd have to make it

	create the system
		xapix api for flights / bookings







automated replies / rescheduling for meetings that you may miss when you get a flight delayed + automated hotel / taxi bookings

	xapix api for flights / bookings
	google calendar api
